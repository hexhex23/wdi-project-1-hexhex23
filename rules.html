            Ring of Fire is a drinking game, best played with three or more players. Each player takes a turn picking a card, in the case of this online game, it would be to click on the "Next Card" button.<br />
            <h3>Set Up</h3> To set up the physical game, prepare a cup for each player, already filled with the preferred drink. In the center of the players, prepare an empty pint class, called "The Dirty Pint"<br />
            <h3>Game Play</h3> Each number on the card represents a different rule, which the players must follow. The penalties for most cards are to drink a mouthful from the player's own cup. The game ends when the 4th King card is drawn. The player who draws this card
            has to drink The Dirty Pint.
